Bitcoin Machine Learning Trading Strategy

Credits: This project was made possible through the following resource: Machine Learning and Data Science Blueprints for Finance (Book)

Description: This project tests a Bitcoin trading strategy by combining technical analysis with machine learning. A Random Forest classifier was trained to generate buy/sell signals based on features including RSI (Relative Strength Index), Moving Averages, Rate of Change (ROC), Stochastic Oscillator, and Price Momentum. The model was tuned using Grid Search and achieved an accuracy of ~94% in predicting market signals.

The predicted signals were used in a trading simulation, resulting in a strategy that achieved a Sharpe ratio greater than 4, closely matching the performance of following actual market returns.
